  installation. The first user account must be created by clicking on the
  "Register" link.

  #### Additional Licensing
  Jabbr is open sourve under the [MIT
  Licence](https://github.com/JabbR/JabbR/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

  #### Logging in via Remote Desktop
  The Administrator password is included in the passwords/secrets section
  of this deployment. Use that password and the instructions found
  [here](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-to-your-server-via-rdp-windows)
  to login and begin managing JabbR.

  #### Uploading Files via FTP
  The FTP password is included in the passwords/secrets section
  of this deployment. You may use [Filezilla FTP Client](https://filezilla-project.org/)
  or [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.io/) with the FTP credential to upload your application.

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This setup was built through a [Powershell
  Script](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd742419.aspx).
  Once the deployment is up, the script will not be run again, so it is
  safe to change settings and configurations on your server and within JabbR.
