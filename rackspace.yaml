  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to JabbR, once the deployment is ready, you will get Jabbr
  signin page by browsing the domain name you provided during the
  installation. The first user account must be created by clicking on the
  "Register" link.

  #### Additional Licensing
  Jabbr is open sourve under the [MIT
  Licence](https://github.com/JabbR/JabbR/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

  #### Logging in via Remote Desktop
  The Administrator password is included in the passwords/secrets section
  of this deployment. Use that password and the instructions found
  [here](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-to-your-server-via-rdp-windows)
  to login and begin managing JabbR.

  #### Uploading Files via FTP
  The FTP password is included in the passwords/secrets section
  of this deployment. You may use [Filezilla FTP Client](https://filezilla-project.org/)
  or [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.io/) with the FTP credential to upload your
  application.

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This setup was built through a [Powershell
  Script](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd742419.aspx).
  Once the deployment is up, the script will not be run again, so it is
  safe to change settings and configurations on your server and within JabbR.
